# Miss Mikey May's Music Madness

This is the source code for my music site. If you happened to stumble in here, I congratulate you on having too much free time. 

The site and this source code is probably not interesting at all from a geek-standpoint, it's just how I like to do things around here. 

I'm sure some Web developers would raise some eyebrows at some of the hacks I did, but hey it looks decent on browser and mobile so I'm happy.

The site was built with Jekyll and published with GitHub Pages, and the (very hacked) template is based on the awesome open-source [Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) theme from the awesome open-source folks at [Start Bootstrap](http://startbootstrap.com/).

Licensed under Apache 2.0 (same as forked theme).
